This series of exercises is provided by Noah Mayor and Julia Villiger, trainee chemistry laboratory assistants, at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL).

For each sample the proton (1H) spectrum is provided.

It is divided into 3 series in order to show students the different NMR experiments:

- NMR of organic solvents
- Simple exercises
- Medium exercises

You can either provide the link to all the series or to a specific series.

This series is part of a set of exercises:

- [1H](https://nmrdata.github.io/nmr-dataset-apprentis-1h/): Only proton NMR is provided
- [13C](https://nmrdata.github.io/nmr-dataset-apprentis-13c/): 13C (could be coupled and/or decoupled) spectra are provided
- [COSY](https://nmrdata.github.io/nmr-dataset-apprentis-cosy/): Only COSY spectra are provided
- [HSQC / HMBC](https://nmrdata.github.io/nmr-dataset-apprentis-hmbc/): Both HSQC / HMBC spectra are provided
- [Full](https://nmrdata.github.io/nmr-dataset-apprentis-full/): All the spectra available are provided
